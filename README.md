The goal is to build a client facing front end where they enter their email, business name, as well as social media sites. They would also need to be able to pay for the test, so we would need it to be able to connect to stripe. On the back end of the project, we would like a Web crawler to be able to, search through their website, social media sites, and develop a scored test for them on how well their branding looks across each platform. Then we would like for it to send them an automated email with their score, and outlining their ideal packages that we already have built out for them.
